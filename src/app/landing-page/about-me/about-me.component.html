        <h2>About me</h2>
        <span>Hi there! I am a Front-end developer based in Gefrees, Germany. Since the age of 17 I have faced various
            challenges in my work as an office management assistant as well as in further educations, but my fascination
            for the world of
            programming has persisted throughout those years. This is why, in early 2023, I decided to quit thinking
            and start doing by signing up for a boot camp at the Developer Akademie in Munich - it was time to turn my
            visions into reality!</span>

            <span>Through the academyÂ´s practical-oriented approach I was able to continuously improve my programming
                skills by crafting various web-apps and websites - by myself as well as in a team. The challenges I
                faced during this time have become my source of motivation and every success - no matter how great - has
                further invoked my passion for this field.</span>

            <span>Working in the textile industry since 2021 has only further improved my organization skills, as it
                involves managing diverse inputs daily - such as color, size, material and textile types. This
                experience has
                equipped me with the systematic approach necessary for handling complex projects.</span>
